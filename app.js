        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "1) In Q2 I made real progress in my goal to align the bookings team and create a collaborative, close-knit and transparent atmosphere. We hosted our first workshop with the topic we thought to be most pressing and relevant, encompassing the above goals, and it was a great success. It really allowed us all to get to know each other better and I feel like everyone got a lot of out of it. Strengthening the bond between the bookings team helps them juggle distributing jobs between them, and ensures they are working in sync with one another.\n\n2) Another successful development I've worked on within the bookings team has been to align our processes and improve everyone's work/life balance. Where juggling lots of jobs and having last minute issues crop up out of hours, I've worked hard to reduce manual processes as much as possible to create a more peaceful working environment. Ultimately, it has led to happier team members and the capacity to handle more jobs as we scale.\n\n3) In January we onboarded the wonderful Liberty, and I have since worked hard to integrate her into Contact and the Bookings Team in a fulfilling and tremendously valuable role. Building a role to take on most of the accounts admin I had previously been looking after was quite hard work, but putting in time to build resources of all the processes and teaching Liberty each step has been so worth it. The wider impact of this move has been great, as it has taken our payments & accounts capabilities to the next level, delivering our promises to our bookers and creatives, and it has also allowed me to concentrate on key areas of management and problem solving that I felt stretched when approaching before.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "1) With the bookings team growing from four members to five, new challenges arose in managing more people. This felt like a shift into really managing a** '**team', where I felt I was spending most of my time delegating, listening and helping. It took a few months to settle into the swing of things, and pushed me to delegate and grow in my managerial skills more than ever. I now feel comfortable in my new found abilities and routine in managing the team and feel fulfilled having it as my main focus each day.\n\n2) With the introduction of metric teams in Q3, the new way of working has been a learning curve for me. I noticed that in moments I felt slightly overwhelmed and needed to rethink the way I approach my to-do lists. It was also a new challenge as a manager, to lead the team on tasks coming from outside of our bookings flow, where different departments required different things. It's taught me to take my time to understand things deeply and consider the impact on the bookings team's workflow, then distributing the tasks, then asking for continuous feedback. \n\n3) For me, a sense of work-life balance is something I continually strive to nurture as life and work themselves fluctuate. I've been proud of myself in both stressful and less motivational periods having found a sense of 'groundedness' in order to keep level headed and perform to the best of my ability.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "1) With the growing team shift mentioned above, I noticed that it took a few months to settle into the swing of things, pushing me to delegate and grow in my managerial skills more than ever. I realised how keen I was to utilise my learning time and resources into developing as much as possible, and I've found this a really fulfilling goal to get my teeth stuck into. It's unlocked a new desire to dev\n\n2) With every performance review, I reflect on my growth in confidence. I feel in a really positive and confident mindset in my role, which is reflected in my actions and how I approach tasks. I've learned to appreciate my natural personality traits and highlight how they can be utilised to be the best manager I can be - instead of trying to fit myself into a different shape of what I once thought a manager should be.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "1) Managerial skills - I'd like to continue developing as a manager in order to better serve my team, allow them to deliver to the best of their abilities and in turn hopefully feeling as fulfilled as possible myself.\n\n2) Metric team leader - Our new metric team systems and ways of working have pushed me outside of my comfort zone and are challenging me to rethink and learn every sprint. \n\n3) Higher responsibility - With every new role I've experienced within Contact has come a higher level of responsibility. By continuing to nurture my confidence and develop my skills across my current role, I can see myself being able to earn even more responsibility as I develop within the company.\n\n4) Fair pay in creative industries & mentoring - I've been thinking a lot about how I can do more to help people, and have come up with a few areas I'd like to explore. It's so special that Contact serves a community to improve their work and lives for the better, and I'd like to even further lean into that in my own role. One area I'm particularly interested in learning about is inequality in pay for marginalised groups within the creative industries. I've also been thinking about personally mentoring younger/more junior creatives. These are things I'd like to think about in my free time and potentially source learning resources about, to explore if/how they might be areas I could explore within my work at Contact.",
        "If you would like, provide any additional information that wasn't captured in the above form.(optional)": "Reflecting and writing up on all of the above has been such a lovely experience. It made me realise how much progress I have made in my professional development and relationship with work and a work/life balance in general. It's great to be so satisfied and I feel inspired to keep progressing and learning. Being a key part of Contact's story since way back is such a gift and I feel so lucky!"

I’ve been able to share best practices which are then effectively carried forward and trickled through them - this has made me really proud to see. Also been able to cultivate a positive, warm little team who aren’t afraid to be open and honest, which I love.\n\n**UX Research.**\n\n- I’ve really enjoyed opportunities where I could get stuck in with activities related to UX Research through H1. Whether it was helping to form and review discussion guides, leading research calls and speaking with users, sharing best practices in collecting that data - it’s been a very fulfilling area of work for me.\n- The impact of this has been a progressive improvement in the quality of our UXR compared to where we were a year ago, in my opinion.\n\n**Product Strategy.**\n\n- Where it’s been appropriate, it’s been great to help form product strategy for our key product areas.\n- This has been a great tool in breaking things down to our product and tech teams, and in understanding how this interlinks with our business strategy.\n\n**Successful board meetings.**\n\n- Slightly funny thing to mention, but knowing what we put forward to our investors is valued and positively received has been a highlight over this period.\n- By achieving this, this naturally helps us maintain good bonds with our investors whilst we are in a period of nurturing this young relationship.\n\n**Moving down to 3 days a week.**\n\n- More of an informal point, but this has brought huge amounts of fulfilment to my life overall in ways I really hadn’t anticipated.\n- I believe that being able to come to work having been able to properly switch off from work each week has kept my internal stress levels lower overall. It has meant I’ve been able to be more clear minded and objective in my contributions each week.\n- Since moving down to 3 days a week, it is not an understatement to say this has been life-changing for me. My energy management (and overall wellbeing & happiness) has truly blossomed due to the additional time/energy I can pour into other areas of my life.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "**Messy Q3 planning.**\n\n- I found this event to be quite challenging overall for multiple reasons. Some of these include: being away sick for an important period of this event, observing a lack of leadership steering this as it unfolded (and consequently quite a lot of pressure to help wrap things up upon my return), having to help PMs rollout quite a change in operational format (as cross-department teams) in a tight timeframe.\n- I also found this event overwhelming due to the realisation of how much of this important event has somewhat relied on me to lead in the past. It is not to say that I believe I have solely led this in the past, just that the weight of driving this has been felt by me in the past.\n- This has felt quite high pressure as it is essentially a quarter’s worth of company energy and expenditure towards a designated strategy. Consequently, I feel it is something that should instead be lead by the leadership team as a confident set of leaders on behalf of the entire company.\n- In this instance, I don’t feel it has panned out this way, but has instead been passed onto a product manager due to lack of steer and ownership from us as the leadership team.\n- I believe we could have handled this better by being more forthright with leading and owning this as the leadership team, especially as I see it as a responsibility of ours collectively - not a team member at the ground level in the business.\n\n**Lack of clear impact in new role.**\n\n- I think between the shift of being a less hands-on individual contributor **and** a slight role dilution of being a leadership team member, product leader and tech team leader, has resulted in my current role not feeling like it delivers huge value or impact.\n- In my current role as leadership team member / product leader / tech team leader, I think it is hindered by the longstanding ‘decision by committee’ style of operation and flat hierarchy we have upheld at Contact. This is not to say I believe our choices have been negative, but instead, just an observation of what I believe to be a consequence of it.\n- Suggestion for improvement in Question 4\n\n**Uncertainty around my present role.**\n\n- **Product Leadership. **Through H1, I’ve had time to explore whether a product leadership role was something I was energised by. At present, I feel it may not be something truly aligned with my strengths or the challenges I’m most excited by in my work. I struggle to do a brilliant job at this due to the natural stage of where we are as a company, I think. Our near to medium term business strategy is something which I feel is constantly changing (which I can understand), but this consequently makes it hard to form solid product strategies from.\n- **People Manager.** Through H1, this has been another area I’ve had the fortunate chance to explore. I believe I have been able to fulfil this for my DRs to an extent, within my current capabilities and knowledge. At present, I’m not sure this is something I see myself being energised by in the longer term.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "**Gained experience with working on a leadership team**\n\n- I have learnt that I feel comfortable with being a leader, but what I think I may struggle with is leadership in the specifics of our dynamic at Contact. That being, a predominantly young workforce and first-time leaders in the leadership team.\n- I think it was initially empowering and energising being able to provide input which felt valuable and important, and often quite different in perspective to my fellow leadership peers. But as time has progressed, it has progressively become somewhat draining to often feel (at times) like I’m the only person who can see things with a particular perspective or level of clarity, and also to be willing to be open and honest about it.\n- It has also felt increasingly tiring to feel I have to lead quite big, important things on behalf of the company (e.g. best practices instillation, quarterly planning). I adore the willingness of the team to take on suggestions and advice, and I would never berate anybody for simply lacking experience, but it can feel exhausting to feel I have to be at the forefront leading otherwise important things may be missed in the process or not done/forgotten.\n- I feel the weight of wanting us to succeed as a company a lot, and that combined with sometimes feeling like the most knowledgeable person in the room, is a lot to bear. This might just naturally be the consequence of having a predominantly young team who have had limited time in the workforce, but I suspect this is feeding into it.\n- It’s really hard to explain and translate this properly from what I feel to written words. I absolutely do not intend this to come across as though I know best, or that I believe I’m always right - **very far from it! **What I’m trying to convey is the indirect pressure I feel to have to lead on many fronts, which may be tied to our largely young/inexperienced teams and also wanting us to succeed as a company. I am aware that this can be viewed as teaching opportunities, but again, the weight feels heavy because I feel it’s consistently something I need to do to help ensure we’re doing the best possible work (and thus, hopefully protecting the company in the longer run). I have deep compassion for all my team mates as I truly believe we’re all doing our best - I hope this hasn’t been interpreted negatively.\n- Suggestion for improvement in Question 4\n\n**Gained experience with people management**\n\n- Being able to support my direct reports within my current capabilities and knowledge has been wonderful to learn from.\n\n**Learnt how to support the business at board meetings with investors**\n\n- Having to support a business in this way is a first for me, and was a great learning experience!",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "**UX Research**\n\n- This is an aspect of my role which I feel I haven’t had the opportunity to be as hands-on with since moving into my current role, and is something I find myself missing. One of my favourite parts of being a product person is connecting with the real people who use our products and distilling insights from these everyday people. My ability to relate and facilitate are major strengths which would be very valuable in this domain.\n- I would love an opportunity to grow my skillset in this area. I genuinely believe it’s an area of the business that could benefit from consistent, dedicated, quality effort in some capacity. Because so much of what we do relies on good quality discovery, it feels really pivotal for us to get this right. I’m not sure we always do, though it’s improved hugely over this past year in my opinion.\n- By enabling me to lead and own a specific focus area (UXR), I feel I could make more tangible impact and create output which is both valuable and useful for our teams. This would therefore create more fulfilment in my work and contribution to Contact.\n\n**Product Strategy**\n\n- This is a growing skill which I’m progressively honing in on. I enjoy understanding strategy and being able to play a part in impacting it.\n- I look forward to honing in on this with Swati’s support - she’s been brilliant to learn from and I massively appreciate her wisdom and knowledge.",

I am so grateful for having peers who are kind, open-minded and good intentioned.\n\nReuben, I continue to be thankful for your positive spirit, courage and willingness to learn. I am so grateful for your support on many fronts, and that you have helped foster a dynamic in which I trust I can be honest in my thinking with you and operate with true autonomy. It is a privilege!"

        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Having to make the really difficult decision to let team members go was extremely difficult. Marketing was quite badly affected and it wasn't something I'd ever had to deal with before. It's not only the immediate decision that was stressful, but the aftermath of trying to reassure the team and make sure they feel comfortable and engaged still. I'm proud of the way I handled the situation as I truly believe I managed it with as much empathy and care as I possibly could, and as result, made a really rubbish situation kind, and hopefully easier to deal with for those affected.\n\nHaving different priorities across the business has sometimes made it difficult to get things over the line with tech, and that can be frustrating when a member of your team is working on something and you can't help them get it over the line. However, by having a really honest conversation with Reuben about how this was affecting the team, we came to a great solution with Suhael that propelled the Growth team forward tenfold.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I believe I've become more resilient and able to adapt to change even better. I already felt like this was a skill of mine but these last 6 months have seen a lot of shifts and I've been able to deal with them with relative ease, whilst guiding my team and keeping them in the loop of those changes.\n\nI've always tried to be as transparent with the team as possible and I hope that's something that has made any big changes easier for them to manage.

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "Working on the mobile app was really fulfilling and a highlight of my career. I think being able to build a brand new app from scratch (with great functionality) in under 3 months is a great success! The team I worked with were incredible, and we all pulled on each-others strengths to make sure we stuck together and got the job done. Working in an extremely agile and fast paced method meant that things weren't perfect, and some things might have been missed or needed extra detail - but I like to think we built really strong communication paths between us, so that we could ask and be answered pretty swiftly. \n\nThe impact past the small team, I feel has been pretty immense. I think the wider Contact team were happy to:\na) see the previous mobile app be replaced \nb) see the tech team deliver something so quickly and of high quality\nand we constantly received positive feedback throughout the quarter on how nice the app was coming along. This also meant that I had to deal with many stakeholders (Talent Team in ops), and had to build strong relationships with those team members so that they would trust I was building the right solution for them and our creatives. I started this by hosting a workshop with that team, and consistently kept in touch with them throughout the quarter so that were kept in the loop.\n\nOther things I've worked on that have brought impact:\nContact Open\nQ3 Planning\nAutomated NPS Surveys for Creatives\nIntroduction (and closure) of Productboard in attempt to centralise user feedback and prioritise backlogs\nSplitting out the Name field into First Name and Last Name\nIntroduction to Mixpanel\n\nI feel like k have con\n\nI’ve also worked on my presentation skills and ability to talk in larger groups - which is something I wanted to tackle over the last few months.",

Few challenges I can think of would be surrounding the limitations of being able to prioritise and priorities changing, but, it’s what I’m used to given my background in startups so I’m happy to continue forward and adapt.\n\nOne challenge around Contact Open was around misconceptions of what the product would actually be. I think in the research stages before I joined, it was made out to be a extremely big product that was complex, and then having to prioritise features from this led so some confusion from the Contact team where they thought something would be in the app at launch when it wasn’t planned to be. One thing I took from this was to ensure changes and progressions are posted in a public channel so that the wider team can absorb these changes, rather than take a one-to-one approach which",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I’ve become more confident in my position at Contact, and believe that the team trust me to deliver what I say I’ll deliver. I’ve built really strong work relationships across the board and this has led me to be able to push and pull in scenarios to make sure we can deliver new features, improvements, and bug fixes on time.\n\nI’ve learned to adapt my way of working to different people, and adapt my style of communication - without losing my essence or personality.\n\nAs a PM, I’ve continued to adapt to an ever changing landscape and still deliver great work when leading a cross functional team. Being able to identify potential issues that may crop up in the short term and long term, and relay them or put the work in to try and reduce any risks.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "**1. Creative Checkins**\nFor me, the chance to interact with creatives is always I'll always love. Over the past three months I've been here, I've been able to have some really cool conversations and the opportunity to meet the people behind all the pictures. I'm a people person by nature and creative people are my favourite kind of people - because out of everybody, I think creatives dream the biggest. For me, the reason I became a creative coach was because I love to see things become a reality - so I love getting creatives from 'What' they want to achieve to -> 'How' they're going to achieve it. I've been able to do lots of this and provide helpful advice which always makes me feel fulfilled!\n\n**2. Intro Meet & Workshops**\nSimilarly, the intro meets and workshops I've been able to host have been super highlights for me. I really do love empowering, educating and teaching others things that can help improve themselves and their work. I come from a long line of teachers so that might be why 😅 I think in terms of the community team, these workshops have gone a long way in providing support to our creatives, providing them opportunity to interact directly with our team and indeed connect and meet one another.\n\n**3. Lulu**\nThis is a recent one, but a huge one. I'm flagging it here because it was a task unlike anything I'd ever done before. I'm pretty tech savvy, but I must admit I was a little overwhelmed with this task at first - just wasn't sure where to start with it! However, I was very curious and so dug my heels in a little bit, did some research and was well on my way. Thinking back now, maybe I should have asked for help in that moment, but I'm jut glad it all worked out because this is just one of those tasks that when you achieve it, it's completely exhilarating! It was so nice to get praise from the rest of the team too (especially the tech lot 😅). I'm just proud I stuck at it and figured it out in the end!",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "**1. Asking for help**\nThis still remains I huge one for me - although I am getting more confident with asking for help when I need it, I'm still not doing it as often as I should, which sadly is slowing me down in certain areas. This is definitely something that I need to personally work on over the next quarter. Currently having a preference to ask questions privately rather than publicly, but I want to work on that that so I can get the answers I need much faster.\n\n**2. Team changes**\nThis is definitely the elephant in the room - now that all of the other members of the team I joined just three months ago will be gone by the end of this month, I'm definitely nervous. Losing my line manager so early on was definitely a hard pill to swallow, especially in terms of my relationships within the company. With that being said though, it forced me to venture out of my bubble and work with new people more regularly and get involved with wider conversations. I now also think that I'm able to work more independently than before because the opportunity presented itself and I decided to rise to it. Upon reflection, I believe that the changes within the team have overall been a good thing for my personal development because I've had to learn even faster, pick up new responsibilities and represent my new adopted community of creatives much more. Shannon has expressed how much confidence she has in me and that has helped me to see that no matter what challenges come my way, I should see them as the opportunities that they are and take them in my stride.\n\n**3. Boundaries**\nLinked to the above, just when I think I fully know my role, it changes again. I came into this role as someone who values clarity and is super goal-orientated, as I like to know I'm hitting all expectations. These past few months have clearly shown me that life can't always be like that - especially in startup culture. So, whilst the boundaries of my role keep on shifting, I'm learning to allow room for the change and just 'roll with the punches' as they come. Once I got over the initial mental hesitation, I realised that with all the boundary-shifting came really exciting moments to learn, engage and deliver new things. Looking forward to this next chapter!",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "When I made the transition from being self-employed full time to joining the team, I definitely knew that things were going to be different for sure. A few key things have stood out for me:\n\n**1. Time Management & Prioritisation**\nI view myself as a highly organised and focused person, I'm also incredibly task-orientated so getting things done is a natural part of my psyche. Since joining the team and having increasingly more responsibilities added to my plate, I've learnt the power of time management. I thought I was pretty good before, but I feel like I've been stretched even further. If anything, through conversations with other on the team, I'm increasingly learning to scratch out time intensive manual tasks to speed up my efficiency and increase my capacity for bigger projects. This has also had a positive effect on my personal life, external projects and side hustles too!\n\n**2. Speed & Collaboration**\nMainly due to my nature as mentioned above, I really used to struggle with collaboration to a certain extent. I like to get things done and ticked off, so I can feel my most productive. I've come to learn (as highlighted through my Sanctus coaching session) that this is because I have tied much of my value to my levels of productivity - which I guess is something innate for me, plus working solo for so long doesn't help either! The impact of this was initial frustration when required to collaborate with others, because I couldn't see the immediate results. Learning to trust the process and trust the brilliant people I get to work with everyday because the things we do come up with when I lean into collaboration have been straight 🔥\n\n**3. Bigger Picture Thinking**\nI think I've finally got to the point where I understand that I'm the voice of our creatives on the team. With this now in mind, I find that I'm now beginning to ponder on things that lie outside of my immediate tasks or indeed role. This is something I've definitely picked up since joining the team, because I see how others offer their suggestions and opinions on things that may not be directly related to them, but through the lens of their nuanced experience within the team. This is exciting for me because I feel like I'll be able to better represent our creatives, their needs and indeed their growth.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "**1. Talent Scouting**\nI would love to learn the process of talent scouting and indeed casting etc. It was on my list of things to do when I first joined (i.e. join Alice for one of her castings/polaroids days) but sadly never got round to it and it was forgotten. Also, super curious around the rating system in place (Contact fit/Client Fit) - what variables are these based on? etc. \n\n**2. Marketing**\nI want to make the workshops more of a big deal because only a very small percentage (approx. <1.5%) are participating in them, and the same names seem to be popping up too. I want to be able to build out a more comprehensive marketing strategy across our socials and even perhaps the website too, so that we can attract more attendees. The way I see the workshops, I desire to have guests regularly and open some up to non-Contact creatives and new talent reps too as a means of lead generation. Whether that includes videos/social media posts etc. I wanna be able to drive more traffic towards our workshops!\n\n**3. Test Shoots**\nThis is something that I'm super glad I'm going to be able to work on. I really love connecting people and helping to make creativity happen, so I think setting up Test shoot events (maybe one every Q) would be a great way to do this. I'm hoping this will eventually birth many other exciting events such as exclusive masterclasses, retreats and socials for our creatives!",
        "If you would like, provide any additional information that wasn't captured in the above form.(optional)": "Another weak spot for me right now is data - flies over my head 90% most of the time! I should say that this typically applies to company-wide data. I want to spend a little time getting more comfortable with understanding it as it takes me a little more time to process it. I think the more understanding I have of it, the more I'll be able to interpret and provide insights from our creatives.\n\nI'm anxious to discuss the next steps for the community team as I'd like to be prepared as much as possible - if that includes shadowing Alice on her next castings day, then I'd be willing to do that!"

Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "**Ownership and independence within design team**\nA goal that came mostly from peer feedback last review cycle, was equipping Mikey and Rashmi to work closely and confidently with their respective product manager, with limited hand holding from myself. While of course I've look to provide regular catch ups and crit sessions with my team, it has been brilliant to see Rashmi work so well with Simon, and Mikey with Arun, during periods where I've been slightly immersed elsewhere, or simply away on holiday. The team feels stronger and more confident, which ultimately is my main goal as a manager. \n\n**Overseeing continuous improvements to the booker experience**\nI greatly enjoyed being involved in the research and concept ideation for new booker features earlier in the year. Coupled with the new CAJ header shipping — multi vertical bookings, the new booker dashboard, and the bookmarking feature (shipping next week), have all been a big step forward for bookers on Contact. \n\n**Embracing leadership initiatives**\n\n- 5 step plan\n- No Meeting Weds\n- New office\n- Cost of living pay / Pay backdating\n\nI think I've become more confident sharing my thoughts and being decisive around leadership decisions, in particular within the last 3 months. I've enjoyed leading on, or being involved in various initiatives, such as the ones mentioned above.

        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "One goal was to really progress with the standard of what we ship. While I do think I've contributed to improving this standard, if realistic, a switch of focus occurred in the spring to **truly prioritise shipping quickly and often — which has at times proved a challenge against the original goal**. Related, we've also often opted for \"tacking on\" additional features instead of really rethinking aspects of our design, again to prioritise speed. However, I'm confident with really nailing a balance before we hit 2023.\n\n**At points it's felt challenging to truly be present for team members**, but specifically around the various design projects they have worked on. If honest, I do think I fell short frequently earlier in the year, especially with Mikey (him working on a separate product was an easy excuse to be slightly detached). However we've established a really solid flow in the last few weeks, after some useful tips from my coach. I think the key change will be designated days for me to dedicate to each team/person.\n\nI had a goal to work on a branding project, and obviously **the blocker here was that it was delayed!** I'll likely be less involved when we pick this up eventually, but it's still a goal to oversee its implementation.\n\nFinally, it's **sometimes felt hard to really be motivated with nailing down and improving our internal design team process**, when so much wider process and structure has constantly changed (2 different squad structures, 3 different OKR planning strategies, etc). However, I'm really happy with the latest squad revamp and feel empowered with how design can contribute (especially through the R&D squads).",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "**Stronger decision maker within leadership decisions**\nAs hinted above, I do think I've progressed with being more proactive within various leadership discussions and ideas. In the past I've possibly been content with mostly listening and minimal participation, but I've actively tried to be more a louder voice and also a decisive voice. I think this has helped get various initiatives over the line, and ultimately help the company. \n\n**Built awareness and learnt more about how my team like to work and grow**\nMy critical review of the 6 months is that I've not always supported Mikey and Rashmi closely enough. But to look toward the positive, I've definitely learnt a lot about how they like to work, what motivates them, and what support they're after. I'm really eager to utilise this moving into the future.\n\n**I've learnt a LOT about how to work with metrics**\nI'm confident I've up-skilled in how to build OKRs around a lean and mean collection of metrics, and how that feeds through to day-to-day work and sprint planning. I've learnt more about the pros and cons of metrics driven culture, and look forward to continue this learning moving forward.",

I want to lean towards quick-fire research and hypothesis testing, which is sometimes where we've struggled in the past (so a positive step forward for Contact) \n\n**Clearly demonstrate how design can improve our key metrics**\nEither first hand through my design work in Engagement team, or through the design work elsewhere in my team, I'm excited and motivated to utilise design to get our key metrics move upward. \n\n**Build our wider design system for product, brand, and marketing**\nEveryone's likely bored of me chatting about design system goals now, but for the first time in a year, Suhael has unblocked my vision for a fully in-sync design system between both design and engineering. We've already started with baby steps on this new design system, and I'm hyped to get this fully launched later in the year. I'm eager to simply learn by doing in this area. This will be a huge step forward for Contact, improving the our speed of shipping even further, but also the quality of what we're building.",

The positive responses from our creatives on how the deck has helped them with filming their self-tapes and understanding industry terminology highlighted the value in creating resources such as these for our creatives. By creating the deck, this increased the operational efficiency of the bookings team as this reduces the manual responses to models on frequent questions that crop up.\n\nLapsed Booker Meetings and Reach-outs: It's great to connect with bookers in person and continue building rapport with the bookers. Super friendly and a really nice switch up to the day-to-day of the working week. This has been really rewarding as I've always enjoyed a varied workload that involves being a part of different projects. I believe it's also had a positive impact amongst the team, in getting valuable feedback on our platform and where we can add to our platform. \n\nHandling LANE castings- the monetary value of these jobs is super rewarding, and seeing how it contributes towards our OKR revenue targets. The jobs I've managed totalling over £32,000 when we've factored in all the model fees, usage and recall fees from Lane casting briefs. I really enjoyed taking on the challenge of Lane briefs, the jobs tend to be more complex and I always learn something new. For example, where we can implement additional fees such as wardrobe, recall and travel day fees. This has positively impacted how I've been able to handle other jobs that require less manual steps. It has also helped inform how I get to certain fees on other jobs, using the briefs as a reference point for usage.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Transparency:\n\nOne of my goals last quarter was towards creating events for our bookers to increase revenue and gauge further feedback on the platform. A lot of planning went into the booker dinner event and there was a budget blocker with this.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "Public Speaking- My confidence with public speaking has improved so much when it comes to speaking in the Operations Showcase and on All Hands. This has also helped with my confidence in speaking across team meetings and putting forward more of my ideas. One of my goals was to feel less anxious before having to present. Utilising meditation and the sanctus coaching sessions to work through this has really helped with my personal growth. \n\nIndependent problem solving- I've encountered difficult client situations that I've navigated more independently, this in turn has developed my problem solving skills and I find it easier to handle situations that crop up with other bookers. I feel more confident in handling and diffusing these situations, where we're able to come to a resolution for the booker and our creatives. \n\nMore nuanced in negotiating rates and increasing the fees for models, I believe my success rate has improved in getting the rates higher for our creatives, below examples of these instances:\n\nNyome SWIM: initial job was £500 for a day, pushed to £1.5k\nLime Scooters: initial job was £500, pushed to £2,5k per model\n\nThis has positively impacted my goal which is to always secure higher rates for creatives so they're paid fairly.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "Client Succession/Experience- To continue developing the skills that help towards improving our bookers' experience with Contact. I really enjoy meeting bookers in person, so I'm keen to utilise my learning and development days to see what other skills can be explored in this umbrella area. \n\nContinue up-skilling in influencer jobs, this is an area of jobs management that I'm starting out at but it's an avenue I'd love to carve out more time working on. Establishing an influencer division amongst our creatives has a lot of monetary value that could help towards reaching our revenue targets for the next quarter.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "Over the past 6 months, I firstly worked out the direction I wanted to take within the company as I didn’t feel Sales was right for me. My main goal last time was to figure out where and what I wanted to do within Contact, and I feel I have achieved this by moving into the bookings team. My new role has allowed me to focus on the parts of the industry that I’m passionate about and relate more to why I originally joined the company. Working more closely with bookers on managing the shoots, helping with casting through package curation, and dealing more directly with our creatives are all aspects that I love. Once I figured this out, I know this positively effected a few of the teams leads with restructuring teams and working out who they needed to hire & where e.g. Peter with a new sales member, and the bookings team requiring additional help.\n\nFrom moving over to the bookings team, I have really enjoyed learning about different types of bookings and building rapports with new clients. My roster of bookers/jobs was very niche in the sales role, so it’s been very rewarding getting to know a wider variety of bookers and managing a range of different job types. Consequently, I’ve been able to help balance out the workload of the bookings team as I’ve picked up increasingly more jobs at a faster pace as time has gone on. It’s also helped to broaden my knowledge as well as the bookings team, with the different types of jobs and experiences we’ve all had and shared with each other.\nThe casting aspect of the role has specifically brought me a lot of fulfilment, as I really enjoy putting together packages for clients. When a booker’s shortlist has come from my package and the job is confirmed, it feels incredible rewarding. I feel package curation from the bookings team is incredibly vital in securing jobs, as it helps ensure brands are seeing relevant creatives to what they require. If we can’t fulfil a package request, it’s also useful in speaking to the community team about the types of creatives we’re lacking for important clients.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "My goals were originally based around my Sales role so I can’t specifically feedback on them with my role changing. However, I have felt a slight blocker with client responses due to joining the bookings team later. When I have picked up jobs with repeat bookers or reached out to one time/lapsed bookers, I think this may have been frustrating/inconvenient for bookers that were already familiar with certain members of the bookings team. I hardly received any responses from reach outs I’ve sent, compared to the rest of the team meaning it wasn’t such a productive use of my time results wise.\n\nHowever when I was slower at picking jobs up on the platform to begin with, I focused a little more on briefs coming through via email which was similar to my sales process. This has helped me gain more close contacts that consistently send briefs through, outside of the repeat bookers coming into the platform. I’ve also made a conscious effort to pick up more jobs from new bookers so I can build up a relationship with them from scratch.\nI would also say time management has been a little tricky for me, which I have improved at. As I managed very few bookings at once in the sales team, the pace of picking up jobs was difficult to begin with when I first moved over to the bookings team. I also realised it can be tricky to plan my time as no job is the same and you can’t always predict how manual they are going to be. I feel due to dedicating more time to jobs as my primary focus (some being a lot smoother than others), I’ve got behind with other tasks. \n\nOne particular task that I haven’t been able to dedicate as much time to is voting on creative applications. It was agreed that I would carry on voting as I missed parts of the talent team role from when I joined the company, & I really enjoy scouting/casting. It seemed beneficial to have a member of the bookings team’s pov too, so we could make sure that everyone we onboard is a good fit for some of our clients/job types. I was able to keep up with this at first when I wasn’t managing as many bookings, however I currently haven’t been able to do this in a few months. Part of this is also due to the fact that the community team have put a slight hold on this with members of the team leaving, and prioritising other aspects of the company. I used to work closely on this with Benji every couple of weeks but I haven’t had time to commit to this in ages. \nAdditionally I used to dedicate a small amount of time to scouting creatives that we are lacking, from observations and experiences of speaking with bookers and receiving briefs. I have missed doing this part of my role so I checked in with Alice to see if voting is something that they would still like me to take part in. Alice has said it would be useful for me to continue as she’s trying to catch up with applications, so I’m going to make a conscious effort to start voting on these again. \nAs part of the retention team, I’m also going to be highlighting ‘new creatives’ in our one time booker mail outs so this ties in very well. I chose to take this email topic as I want to improve my familiarity with our newer creatives, and I enjoy working on community team related tasks too due to my experience and interests.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "Due to the nature of the sales role I was in, I became very used to trialling things which I’d then have to reflect and feedback on. I think this approach has helped improve my confidence and familiarity with giving thoughts and feedback, particularly on topics like the platform/product. It’s helped adapt my mindset, so if I notice an issue/blocker, I’ll then analyse how I think it could be resolved rather than just flagging the issue. \nDue to this, I’ve also realised my opinion is more important & valid from a sales & bookings pov than I would have originally thought. This has encouraged me to get more involved with discussions e.g. conversations about suggested improvements or issues over slack. \nI also realise that from the unique position I was in within my sales role, many newer members of the company have wanted my insight and I’ve been able to help them through explaining my individual experience.\n\nI have also developed skills and knowledge from being on the jobs team. My awareness and experience of dealing with different types of bookings including varying rates & usage has grown significantly. The types of jobs & niche group of clients I had in my sales role were relatively similar & consistent, whereas the recent bookings I’ve dealt with have really pushed me out of my comfort zone. I’m a lot more comfortable with negotiating parts of a booking, without always needing a second opinion like I used to. \nI’ve also learnt to adapt my approach to managing jobs depending on who I’m working with, such as with certain casting directors and their specific habits. I’m not as concerned or hesitant to pick up more complex jobs (e.g. bigger/more manual/international) that require call outs or intro tapes etc. I initially found these types of bookings intimidating to take on so I’m pleased with the progression I’ve made here. It’s allowed me to significantly help out the rest of the bookings team, and manage bookings more efficiently so we’re likely to confirm the jobs. It also helps to vary my workload & the type of work as the bookings are all different. This keeps the role more exciting.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "I have said this for a while, but I feel a particular area of knowledge I want to develop is on ‘usage’. I have already learnt a lot from the bookings team but I still know there’s a lot of room for improvement. I haven’t really dealt with any jobs including huge/extended usage or buyout fees etc like the rest of the team. I feel this restricts my confidence and ability with certain jobs so I’d like to take my understanding of usage to the next level. I know potential workshops and guide’s have been mentioned about usage which would be very useful, so I’m even more equipped and experienced for bookings in future.\n\nAnother skill I’d like to build on is my wellbeing towards work balance. I don’t feel immense pressure or stress at all, but I haven been finding it difficult to switch off after work/at weekends due to issues with previous shoots. The nature of tight turnarounds can be tricky to manage fully within working hours which plays on my mind. I know it’s not possible to completely prevent things going wrong, but I’d quite like to try and improve my approach towards this and not letting it take over at times. I think a couple other members of the team have used up skill days to focus on similar work wellbeing, so I’d like to see if these could help me. I know it’s down to me and setting my own boundaries, but it would be great to shift & open my mindset so it seems more natural. I already enjoy work so I think improving this would just ease things and make it even more enjoyable.\n\nLastly, I’d also like to refine my role progression/career within Contact more. I feel very appreciative and happy to be in the bookings team and that I’m growing skills & knowledge wise, but I feel unsure of how I can progress upwards within the team/company currently. I know this is effected by a lot of different factors within Contact, but having a clearer picture on my specific role progression is something I’d like to figure out with others and work towards.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "Working more closely with Simon and the rest of the engineering team has been super uplifting and has helped me progress my skills of working within a team much faster. \n\nI really enjoyed getting involved in the end-to-end design process for the \"Speeding up the CAJ flow\". I got to complete user interviews and get involved with research projects which led to a series of different design projects such as bookmark creatives and multi-vertical bookings. These projects were quite long however they really helped me learn how to collaborate with engineers and product and keep in sync with them throughout the whole UX process. It showed me the importance of doing this, as by the time i was ready to handover the designs - it felt like everyone was already on the same page on what needed to be done. Whilst the design projects that developed from the research phase were fairly long, I believe next time we will be able to break down each design project into smaller chunks - nonetheless the project overall was extremely fulfilling as I got to exercise my skills as a product designer across the board and learn how to work effectively and efficiently with product and engineering along the way. I would love to do more end-to-end UX projects where we take time to gather data and research and understand a problem before moving into design - and when we finally do move into the design phase we can break down the design projects into smaller bite-sized tasks.\n\nThe overall impact this had on the company was that our designs had a strong basis in data and research and we confidently made the right steps forward to improve our product as a team. Throughout the process, thanks to our tight-knit tech team we were able to smoothly handover the designs and get them shipped with minimal hiccups.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Engineering tickets are sometimes created prematurely before designs have been finalised. Whilst I understand there is a pressure to get designs out as fast as possible, sometimes engineering tickets are being created on designs that I am still working on/ awaiting feedback on. It would be great if I had the chance to give the green light on the designs, mainly because I am usually waiting on feedback or am yet to add annotations on the designs which would be helpful for engineers. I think this could be avoided by just letting me know when engineering tickets are being made on designs so that I have a chance to tie up any loose ends :)\n\nA small blocker would be our frequent team changes, since joining I have become a lot more comfortable working with product and engineering ensuring we remain in sync with designs and collaborate with one another efficiently and effectively. I believe we definitely found an amazing dynamic thanks to the consistent retros as well as socials where we've gotten to know each other better. However I am a little unsure about the latest changes to our team in light of the new Q3 OKRS as it now includes people who are outside of the tech team and a slightly different structure, i.e marketing and data etc. I think over time we will find a great dynamic, as we continue to understand each others areas of expertise as well as ways of working, but sometimes frequent team changes can be a blocker as it takes time to get used to working within a new structure and get new teams into sync. \n\nAnother challenge was long design sprints- having long design sprints meant I would be designing for weeks at a time and engineers would then suddenly have a large amount of features to build which led to burn out on both the design and engineering ends. I think we could have done a better job at breaking down design projects into smaller chunks, but also Simon and I have made great progress in already implementing this in our latest workflows/ projects.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I believe I have become a lot more confident collaborating with Product managers as well as working more closely with engineers. It has been amazing to see how our feedback from retros have turned into actions, it really feels like our voices across the team are always being heard and our needs are always being prioritised. Simon has been amazing at ensuring our team is always progressing with projects smoothly and making sure we all understand one another clearly.\n\nI also believe I have made progress in understanding the needs of my engineering team mates a bit better, through consistent collaboration with them which has given me a good idea of what their strengths and limitations are.\n\nI also have made progress in building my animation skills thanks to Mikey's After effects tutorials and the immense support i've received from Jack. My 1-1s with Jack have been great as a lot of my concerns or needs are almost always met with actions on his end, which I greatly appreciate.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "I would love to take more of a lead on certain product areas, now that I feel more confident with my designs and ability to comfortably collaborate with product and engineering. For example I would like to get more involved in ideating design tasks and epics, discussing and doing research on how our product can be improved within the realms of engagement and acquisition; collaborating with Simon and Jack along the way. Perhaps this could also involve more cross team workshops!\n\nI would love to improve my animations skills, which I have made a start on thanks to Jack and Mikey. It would be great to work on animations projects which help improve my animation skills further whilst also improving our user experience at the same time.",
        "If you would like, provide any additional information that wasn't captured in the above form.(optional)": "With the recent changes for Q3, whilst I understand the focus is to have shorter design sprints which are limited to 2 weeks, I would love for the projects I work on to still be just as challenging as the longer design sprints I have worked on. It would be great to work on projects that would take a week or week and a half to complete rather than a day or two as it would continue to challenge my creativity and skills across the board and allow me enough time to have a deep dive into certain problems which exist within the product."

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "One of the key things I have worked on in the last 6 months that have brought me the most fulfilment was setting up my ‘Overdue Invoice Tracker’. This helped me to organise, monitor and appropriately act on the status of every invoice. This helped to bring structure in my daily tasks, but also to visually see the impact of my efforts at the end of each month. I hope that in creating this tracker, and for taking on this role, the impact my team has felt is one of relief; this spreadsheet is available for an up to date status update and just to know that someone is acting on each invoice as necessary. The impact this has had on the company widely is also financial, with chasing invoices I estimated a retrieval of around £30k in overdue payments from when I joined Contact.\n\nWorking on the Quarterly TPA Payments has also brought me fulfilment. Again, setting up my own system that I know will work smoothly every quarter is very satisfying. This key task felt like a step above the ‘Overdue Invoice Tracker’, as the steps in this process needed to work in conjunction with other agencies, their schedules, and also with our own Community Team. In working alongside Julia, Alice, BB and Shannon to set up the TPA payment system I’ve had the chance to work collaboratively and hope my organisation skills are felt to be beneficial to others. As this work had an impact beyond the company, I was proud that with the Q2 payments (my second cycle of TPA payments) I could be of help for other TPA’s, who thanked me for being helpful and I could handle the process independently. When demonstrating the TPA payments process in a group meeting, I felt that my planning, structure, and communication was appreciated. I was really pleased when I received the feedback that my spreadsheets easily communicated the task at hand; that anyone could look over them and clearly read the information, status or completion of a payment. I hope that this has had a positive impact on Contact, as working well with our TPA’s is a big part of our community.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "I found a lot of difficulty, and anxiety, in trying to manage both accounts and job bookings when starting at Contact. Challenges within this was how to manage my time, and some days one focus demanded more time than the other. I felt that in splitting my time, it was hard to complete jobs to the best of my ability. I struggled with confidence when picking up, and managing jobs, and ultimately this led to me feeling anxious in my day-to-day. It was therefore harder to achieve my account management responsibilities and goals too. I felt this was overcome with the help of Kirsty and Shannon, who helped to create a safe space to talk honestly, and my role and responsibilities were adapted moving forward. We worked through solutions and how to expand my role in accounts; picking up creative’s payments, research into booker payment habits and future projects (a biannual invoice report, TPA Commission History Report and ‘Advance’ advance payment tracker). I’m now really excited to take on these projects and goals and create resources that I hope will be useful company wide.\n\nAnother** **challenge and blocker I had within this review period was having limited access to some areas of accounts. Without a login to the online banking, I felt bad checking in regarding specific payments with Kirsty and also relying on her availability to make manual and batch payments. I also found it tricky to have limited knowledge around payment statuses in Xero - I was unsure if the updates were being kept up to date or simply if there were none. As I only have partial visibility, this made it harder for me to achieve my goal of staying on top of payments and making creative payments, as there was sometimes a delay in the process. With banking being a sensitive area, I know that solutions aren’t always easy and this may just take time to adapt to on my part.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "The biggest way I feel I have developed during this review period is in my confidence: taking ownership of my role, acting independently, knowing when to lean on team members or when to pick up invoice and payment queries. I believe this has positively impacted my performance, as my self-belief in replying to queries or concerns no longer makes me feel anxious, and in turn I feel far more productive. I feel that I have set down a solid foundation in my first 6 months at Contact and hope to expand my role and knowledge moving forward.\n\nIn my past, I have been used to working very independently, and I feel I have developed in knowing when, and how, to work collaboratively. Having weekly accounts meetings with Kirsty means we have dedicated time to work through and complete more complex account issues together. Knowing when to help the bookings team with picking up vendor forms, or invoicing queries has also felt really satisfying and I’ve enjoyed building relationships where we can lean on each other for help. I feel that this will help the ops team in the future, knowing that they can rely on my assistance and also for my personal development in this area.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "I would love to develop my technical knowledge in book keeping and accounts management. I believe that participating in a short course, or gaining a qualification in this areas, would be beneficial when faced with external queries, how to handle difficult situations, and will help me produce more accurate, and technical, reports on our invoice tracking. Aquiring understanding of tax and vat codes means I will also be able to further advise with paper work and legalities that we face in the bookings team and, hopefully one day, the organisation as whole.\n\nIn the next review period I would really like to refine my relationships with both creatives. With payments and finances being a personal topic, I feel like I would like to develop my relationship with our creatives even further. This may be in beginning to offer calls with our creatives or joining in on workshops around payments with BB, I would generally like to add a face to the name. I hope that in adding a ‘human’ element, payments may not be such a scary area for our creatives. I hope this will ultimately help the team, causing fewer panicked or unhappy creatives through Zendesk and overall help creatives feel they can rely on Contact, down to being paid for the jobs they take on.",

It has improved the experience for our creatives and we've had good reviews. Unfortunately it was not a money makes so we've had to put it on ice for the time being and focus on other priorities. \n\nBuilderIO has been another project that brought me fulfilment. Seeing the marketing team creating landing pages with ease is very rewarding.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Being a smaller team with a big goal has impacted my learning time. I have had less time to focus on my personal goals that were not related to the project I was working on. I overcame them by pivoting to the goals that were more aligned to the project and also finding bits of time where I could learn instead of using the learning day convention.\n\nAnother blocker has been working with only 1 other engineer. Sometimes Jack would be caught in other work and would be unresponsive for some time. This made me feel lonely, but would also provide me with some time to rethink the situation. Many times I would come up with the solution myself or I would focus on something else while waiting for help.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "This review period I've learnt how to encourage people to take what they have in their head and write it down. I had many moments when I needed Jacks help with things I wasn't very familiar with and I've asked him to write documentation so I wouldn't disturb him. This allowed me to be more independent of him and I've noticed that he was doing it afterwards without my input.",

This would help me progress through my career as a potential future manager but also benefit the team. I hope I can impact other people's career as well, but I need to learn how to do it in a meaningful way.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "Multi-vertical bookings - following the hard work through the quarter to become more cohesive as a team we were able to deliver what is a massive, fundamental change to the way our jobs work in a short time frame, with relatively little stress. It was particularly satisfying that we were able to release many of the changes ahead of time to de-risk the launch. We're at very early days in terms of the impact, but we've now seen 4 multi-vertical bookings on the same job since launch and we're seeing good engagement with the vertical selector, so the future is looking bright and it opens us up for many strategic opportunities key to the future of the business.\n\nAcceleration of team delivery - with the team changes in Q1/Q2, we had quite a bit of forming up to do to fall into positive patterns of working. I was particularly happy with some of the retros and small ways of working iterations we introduced as a team, and felt we made strides following activities like the 'comfort' retro looking at what encourages people to share their opinions, which had an immediate impact on opening up some of the quieter members of the team. Similarly the 'pace vs polish' retros shone a light on where we want to go as a team and have helped us continue to reduce the scope of the work we're taking on moving into Q3. Although quite hard to put into concrete numbers, given the complexity of the work changing, we saw our story points per sprint increase from ~30 at the start of the quarter to over 50 by the end. The team at large was able to learn from the mistakes of the CAJ flow header and move much faster following this, which was particularly gratifying.\n\nQ3 planning across Acquisition & Engagement - I felt this went well (albeit starting too late in Q2!) and my leadership and support was well received across both teams and both sets of stakeholders. What was better this time round was that I think there was more collaboration and I've been able to get input from the other metric leads as well as the wider teams to build goals that were more bottom-up than previously. I've enjoyed getting stuck into it with the other metric leads and hope that the results of our efforts will show in Q3. \n\nBooker dashboard - although this feature grew in complexity within the quarter resulting in us scaling it back, it was satisfying to see that there was a lot more collaboration on this as an epic, with Engineering and Design operating much more cohesively as one team solving a problem. Moreover, I believe that the long term benefits of the dashboard will be felt through Q3 and beyond as it sets us up very nicely for all manner of additional features in the future. I've been particularly happy to see that the dashboard has been driving jobs submitted, with 29% of views of the dashboard going on to create a job.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "New team with dynamic shift - with the split into teams in Q1/Q2, we definitely had some challenges to overcome. In particular, losing Jack W from the engineering side, there was a need for more junior engineers to step up and take responsibility to lead on the tech side. This meant that there was a lot more energy from my side focused on managing this, particularly earlier in the quarter, which I would have rathered spend on driving forward other initiatives and value to the customer. We overcame this as a team through iteration of our ways of working and through the hard work of the engineers to step up and take more ownership, which was definitely evident in progress made through the quarter.\n\nCAJ header scope creep - this was a real headache, no getting around it. What was billed as a small change, expected to take about a week, ended up taking more than a month. There were a number of contributing factors such as illness, new starters, the off-site and us having just got together as a team... but this wasn't an acceptable way of working, with not enough accountability from the team to push this through, and I wasn't direct enough about the need to get this over the line and in the past. On the positive side, this was a really good learning experience and the team was stronger following this as a result. I equally feel I learned a lot about what the team needed in terms of leadership, with clearer communication and direction, which has helped me develop my communication toolkit.\n\nPlanning timescales - we're currently stuck in a bit of a loop as a business with late planning cycles squeezing us when we start the next quarter and this is definitely leading to some uncertainty and inefficiency at the start of the quarter. We suffered from this at the start of Q2 and again in Q3. We haven't overcome this as a business yet, but I know it's something you are pushing for and I've got faith we can solve it through the Product Team at large.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "Getting more direct - I have been increasingly direct and focused more on deadlines and the impact of not hitting those deadlines through the quarter. This helped us stay much more on track with the multi-vertical bookings feature with clearer communication from the team and fewer surprises off the back of it. In this instance, I made it very clear that the deadline was based on investor needs and illustrated the impact of missing the deadline on our investment case, as well as the impact on end metrics, this led to more openness from the team over any delays, and more creativity with solving any blockers that came up. I believe this has carried forward into a successful start to the quarter with the metric teams.\n\nCreativity with team retros and ways of working - I've formed and normed teams in the past, but generally with more senior team members around me, this time around, there was a different challenge with the new team and a changing landscape in the business. This meant that I had to try some fresh approaches to getting the most out of the team and I really enjoyed getting creative and running with ideas to identify and solve challenges the team faced. I definitely feel that we were in good shape by the latter half of the quarter and that showed through our acceleration. I sincerely hope that the confidence that was growing within the team is carried forward into the new teams with quarter as it will hopefully greatly benefit the business.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "Continue pushing directness - I know I've still got a way to go as it's counter to my natural communication style and I equally want to strike the right balance. So it's one I want to keep pushing on, as I feel it will have a big impact.\n\nMetric focus - something that I generally do already, but I want to push this much more this quarter. Pushing the importance of data for the metric teams and everyone across the business will help us stay on track with our goals. We've got so many ideas, but very rarely are we connecting them to hard data and suggesting what actual tangible impact we could achieve. That's something I want to push on with.\n\nFigma basics - I'm more certain than ever with the smaller changes and scrappier approach that we're employing this quarter, that this will help speed us up! I plan to make this very quick and low effort so I can start making quick changes to illustrate ideas with very low effort in the near future.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "Over the last 6 months, I’ve worked on tasks outside of my daily responsibilities which have helped me develop a wider set of professional and personal skills:\n\n\n1. Working with Kirsty in hosting my first Bookings Team workshop was a great opportunity to work on my leadership, time management and public speaking skills. I enjoyed creating a safe space for my peers and felt a strong sense of fulfilment hearing the positive feedback. I learned a deeper form of empathy and how important it is to take into account others in your team; how to ensure the workshop’s fulfilling for them + received in the best way, how to keep them engaged and what the main important takeaways would be that would in-turn improve their working environment. It was a lovely experience facilitating a workshop that would bring my team closer together. I also saw this as an opportunity to practice my public speaking skills on a small scale, which would help me as I take on more responsibility in future. I’ve also learned how chatty we are as a team and time management would be something to keep an eye on in the next one!\n2. My recent shadowing call with the Commercial Team was also another stepping stone in my progression. I enjoyed taking the time to plan an itinerary and talk Beth and Koby through the daily responsibilities in the Bookings Team. I valued how encouraging and supportive Kirsty was during the process, and appreciate the confidence she had in me with speaking on behalf of my team. This experience taught me how to manage my next shadowing call better with the wider-team in the upcoming months.\n3. Assisting the Hiring Team with screenings earlier this year was one of the most important stages in my progression. I enjoyed contributing to the growth of the company by being the spokesperson for the team. From learning how to structure a screening to churning out quick yet informative notes; I enjoyed every second of this tedious yet exhilarating task and appreciate the interpersonal skills I’ve further developed which I’ve taken on-board with me both in and outside the workplace.\n4. Contributing to the Bookings Team’s goal alignment calls has also been something I’m proud to be writing about in this round of performance reviews. While this is a new responsibility, I’ve already enjoyed speaking with my peers on a deeper capacity and am especially looking forward to ways I can contribute to their progression towards their goals. I, by nature enjoy having more thoughtful conversations and will do all that I can to ensure my peers are supported in whatever way possible. I’ve seen from the start how each of my peers have joined the company and grown professionally, which I’m looking forward to celebrating with them in the months to come.\n5. The last few months has also allowed me to work with Peter on the lapsed booker outreach task and Maylis on the booker email campaigns for Retention’s OKR’s. During Lucy’s time here, I also enjoyed guiding her through package curation and creating tailored packages for her potential leads. Working collaboratively across departments has always been a challenge I’ve tasked myself with since my very first performance review, and in retrospect can see how this has naturally transpired over the last two years.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "While I enjoy experimenting with new ways of working and making adjustments to my workflow, a notable change which blocked my productivity was the jobs tracker. As mentioned when it was first introduced, this created an unintentional feeling of pressure across the Bookings Team which impacted how seamlessly the Bookings Team worked together pre-tracker. I valued how responsive Kirsty and Shannon were when receiving feedback on the tracker and took immediate action to clarify the intentions of the tracker. This feeling very quickly died down after we were reassured, which is a testament to how consistently supportive and reactive Kirsty and Shannon are to blockers flagged in the Bookings Team.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "Upon reflection, I’ve enjoyed taking on more responsibility which has led me to further develop my professional skills. This steady increase in progression has allowed me to adapt at a natural pace without feeling too overwhelmed and has instead motivated me for future challenges to come. I’ve seen how feeling stagnant in my role can eventually give me clarity on where I hope to progress towards and am appreciative of how supportive and patient Kirsty and Shannon had been during the process. \n\nI’ve also enjoyed working across departments and providing insights to contribute to the wider team.  I’ve learned to host workshops, hold shadowing calls and schedule screenings - all of which have improved my skills in public speaking, empathy, active listening, time management, organisation and planning; skills I look forward to utilising as I further progress up the Bookings Progression Ladder.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "I believe the more you practice, the better you become (as cheesy as that sounds!). Rather than prioritising another area of potential I haven't yet explored, I’d like to further refine the skills I’ve acquired over this review period by continuing with similar responsibilities and more. \n\nPlanning another workshop and setting up another shadowing call with the wider team would be a great way to further develop those skills. I’d like to take onboard learnings from my first workshop/shadowing call to create a better experience for those involved. \n \nAssisting with the hiring process is also something I’d like to continue with as not only was it something I enjoyed, I also valued the interpersonal skills I picked up which I’d like to further improve on.\n\nI’m also looking forward to further mentoring my peers by contributing in their goal alignment calls with Kirsty. A natural progression in the Bookings Progression Ladder would be for my role to have a direct report, which I hope this responsibility will help prepare me for.",
        "If you would like, provide any additional information that wasn't captured in the above form.(optional)": "The last month or so had been a difficult time for the company, taking its toll on everyone in individual ways. Not once had I felt unsupported by my peers. I'm however most grateful to Kirsty and Shannon in particular who've been consistently supportive, reassuring and empathetic every step of the way. Finding a workplace you can feel safe and accepted in is one thing, but having caring managers like Kirsty and Shannon who have nurtured, encouraged and listened to me from the day I started is a rarity - so thank you for being amazing and teaching me what it means to lead a team!"

It may take a little while to adjust here.\n-Redundancies/ slight shifts in company culture/size; Initially took me off-balance, but after having seen how the management team handled the necessary steps with kindness and support, I began feeling a little more settled. As the company has grown, there's been/ will be fewer moments of closeness, but the important thing is that the company culture has remained unchanged.

Muscle memory is there, but also a deep understanding of how most jobs work/ will work; it's been rewarding infusing this knowledge with a natural empathy/ always putting creatives' comfort first, as this has allowed me to feel like I'm really making a difference.\n-I've partially moved away from the idea that the platform is to be as self-sufficient as possible, and have seen positive results (Both in terms of personal wellbeing and company goals) in being pro-active at troubleshooting bookers' concerns.\n-I've learnt to understand the flow of my work. Periods of higher productivity can be followed by periods where it's all a little bit overwhelming, and I've got the tools to stay grounded through both.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period?

Its hugely rewarding having a direct impact in bookers' needs and supporting them along the way.\n-I'd like to build my innate knowledge concerning rates/ usage and deliverables. Sometimes my information is a bit too contextual/ reliant on other jobs/ case studies; I'd prefer if I had more of an understanding.\n-I'd like to build on/ make concrete this floaty concern I have that as we grow, our creatives and some bookers will become disillusioned with both our size and image. A private conversation with Gauchoworld solidified this, that as we expand our marketing approach becomes more outwardly 'corporate' and restrictive, this needs to be blunted. Without sounding pretentious/ judgmental, it may be important that Contact remains, in some ways, the voice of a 'cool' community (Primarily within London), as outward signifiers of a brand that's in touch with the concerns/ aesthetics of the youth is hugely important in building trust and curbing skepticism. This is obviously to do with optics/ political signifiers, but in an age of such divisive social politics, it's important that we stay on the right side of the creative industries. I'm unsure of how to materialise this/ if it's even in my remit or important in Contact's direction- but worth considering.",

This, I believe, was a great step for me and the company. I learned how to lead a project (with the support of Hayley) from start to finish. This led me to work with Jack on creating a Design System for both product and marketing. Which would be accessible to everyone in the company and have consistency throughout all the departments. \n\nAnother thing that brought me fulfilment was the PR video. It was a bit of a challenge at the beginning, but after many rounds of feedback and changes, I was really happy with the result.

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "I've loved watching my team members grow and flourish, and my part to play in that. It's incredibly rewarding bringing people on at a junior level and seeing them develop skills that they will have forever. I'm so proud of every single person on my team, and seeing them succeed gives me great fulfilment.  \n\nIt's no secret that the past 6 months have been challenging at points. But I feel content with how I have handled certain situations, and I feel like I have done my job well and continued to grow through difficult times. I've proven to myself that I am strong and resilient and don't need to doubt my capabilities. An example here would be when Julia left the team. Although Alice has handed in her resignation also, I feel like I've managed to keep things quite stable within that team given the circumstances, and I'm confident they feel supported by me despite the many changes they have faced recently. \n\nI'm also proud of how Q2 went and how I steered my team to some great successes. Looking back, we had our best quarter ever for revenue and job submissions, we managed to get our NPS score from 15 > 53.66, and we also increased our job completion % from 38% to 52.11%. I know the performance of these metrics are not solely down to the ops team, but we definitely had our role to play and I know we all worked really hard to reach these targets. I feel I did a good job of motivating my team and giving them clear direction.\n\nHelping out with tasks that benefit the company. I love being there to help people whenever they need me, it gives me a tremendous sense of fulfilment. Even if it's something small like sending over payslips (haha) people are always so grateful and kind and I love supporting this company in any which way I can.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Julia leaving, and now Alice as well have been definite setbacks. I've had to pick up additional responsibilities, and have found it quite challenging taking over what is quite a big role in itself whilst juggling my usual tasks and responsibilities. This has forced me to reassess the community team and the future of it though, which I think is a really good thing to come from it. It's been a long time coming and about time we properly revisited the strategy, and these changes have allowed me to do that.\n\nRedundancies. Never a nice thing to have to do, and my team has now gone from 12 to 8, which has put some additional pressure on other team members (although I don't feel it has actually caused too much of a strain considering) and has probably set us back a little. \n\nIssues with payroll/Deel (international payroll) have still been a bit time consuming at times, and I have spent time on sorting out payroll problems which could have been spent doing other things that probably would have brought us more value.\n\nGetting to grips with new processes, namely the new OKR structure. I definitely felt a bit out of my depth at the start, and was second guessing my capabilities and was feeling a bit self-conscious. I felt like the company was evolving in a way that I no longer felt certain I was the right person for my job - it sounds a bit dramatic, but I did grapple with these thoughts a little. I feel a lot better now and have stopped overthinking these things, I'm taking every day as it comes and using each new challenge that comes my way as a great opportunity for self-development.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I've got a lot better at task prioritisation and keeping on top of my to-do list. It's a small thing, but previously I was using the notes app on my laptop to track my day-to-day tasks, but have started using Trello which I have found to be a game changer for me. Rather than having one long stream of tasks, I divide them into different areas (to do today, this week, this quarter, for example) and prioritise them. This has definitely made me more productive, and less likely to let certain tasks slip.\n\nI also have been trying to take a more experimental approach, spending less time mulling things over and more time spent trying things out and see if they work, being less scared of failure - at least I tried. I've been encouraging my team to have this mindset too. I've really enjoyed coming up with ideas for the engagement team and trying to get these rolled out quickly. I love seeing ideas come to fruition and them having a positive impact.\n\nI have developed as a leader, getting better at saying no to things and shaking off that mentality of 'I have to be doing a million things at once to show I'm competent at my job, or people will think I'm being lazy'. I've made a conscious effort to get better at delegating tasks out, or redirecting people to others who might be a better person to help them with whatever they need helping with. This has given me more time and lightened my load, as well as given people in my team more opportunities for growth and develop their own skills.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "- I'd like to get better at being less reactive when things go wrong. I do think I have got better at this, but case in point is when we had the SA allegation about one of our photographers, I went straight into - 'we need to fix this right away!' mode. I do think I have a tendency to be a bit of a 'fixer' and want to get things smoothed out as quickly as possible. I am learning that this isn't always the best way to approach situations, it's better to take time and gather as much information as possible before reacting in the heat of the moment. Similarly, not taking things that happen at work personally. With Julia handing in her notice and the SA fiasco, I took both of those situations as a reflection of myself and my own mistakes - and actually down because of it. It seems silly to be now looking back, and I think naturally as a sensitive person it is something I need to continue to work on. I will continue to work on myself outside of work and I'm sure that will have a positive impact on myself inside of work too :)\n\n\n\n- I would like to be even more data driven. I have taken steps to up-skill in this area, but it's still something I feel I could be better at. I would like to work more closely with Conor to provide the qualitative data from the operations team to support the quantitive data. I want to continue to be that person in the team who can confidently communicate what our clients and creatives are feeling to the wider company, and helping to drive changes that will ensure our customers have the best possible experience with us.\n\n\n\n- Something that Reuben mentioned on my previous performance review is pro-active problem solving. I do think as my role is so focused on the day-to-day, it can be a bit of a challenge sometimes to be proactive and make changes to systems and processes before a problem arises. I think this is a skill I still have not fully developed, and would like to continue to work on. I think my intuition is pretty spot on sometimes, but I don't always listen to it, or take the actions it's telling me to do, in fear of getting something wrong. Something to continue to work on for sure.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "**Developing Open Product **\n\nAlthough OP is now on ice, it was a real highlight for me to help spearhead the development process in Q1/Q2 and help us plan our GTM strategy. From defining our [target creative](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1knJ6e0ZSvSgqz44B3_c9tXMiNTnubS4Tp9OWm0icCJI/edit?usp=sharing),[ planning our growth strategy](https://www.notion.so/contactxyz/Waitlist-fd793523af12494ca710082cedb65687) (waitlist + invitation mechanism), and [aligning stakeholders](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PY1zs4_Uk3D-WwF3_7VUqGww74RLvInPsdL9B1rHpxY/edit?usp=sharing) across the team, I'm super proud of the progress we made here and feel it sets us up for success if we return to the product in future. It was a really great continuation of all the early thinking I'd done in 2021 to get us to that point. \n\n**Launching a Growth Team**\n\nThis was a big highlight for me in Q2. I loved being given the autonomy to lead a new team and prove its value to the business. I believe that my ability to speak the languages of product and marketing really helped us move at pace and collaborate well cross-functionally. I saw a genuine excitement across the team towards the 15 experiments we launched, and I think it gave us proof that being metric-driven can drive speed, results and high energy within the team. \n**\nSetting up Acquisition**\n\nThis leads nicely into this. It's been great to be able to help steer Acquisition's OKRs, and I'm proud of the work I did in Q2 to help lay the foundations for us to kick off in Q3. I do think that my involvement in quarterly planning, and collaborating with all the teams, really helped push us forward.\n\nI think this (as well as setting up growth in Q1) proved my ability to build a team and introduce a new discipline to the company, with a track record of doing it for Acquisition, Growth and Product Marketing over the past 1.5 years. This is a skill I'm really intrigued by and I think it plays into my enjoyment of product development - of taking a blank slate and leading the creation of something new. I feel like this was what I was able to do through OP, and I'd love to focus on this skill. \n\n**The 5 Step Plan**\n\nI really enjoyed being brought into discussions around our 5 step plan and feel that I was able to add value in building the narrative and planning the presentation back to the team. This was also just fulfilling on a personal level as I feel very personally connected to our journey so was super happy to be closely involved. \n**\nFundraising Announcement**\n\nI really enjoyed working on the narrative for our biggest PR campaign yet, particularly my involvement in our [announcement video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1wIXe67zHg&t=1s). I think this really enabled me to show all the touchpoints a PMM can have, from messaging to brand and creative direction. I'm excited to do more campaigns like this. \n\n**Customer Feedback**\n\nA big win for me in Q1 was [centralising our customer feedback](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RIUg_dVh4b_3mL2rviHriiRlJtWy4Yf7c0i7qBQS_MY/edit#slide=id.p) within Slack. This is something that is now agnostic to our everyday life at Contact, which is awesome. I'm very happy that it's simple to use, and I feel like the whole team understands how we collect feedback now and actively use this process to help them and their teams. So far it's driven the collection of 18 pieces of booker feedback and 29 pieces of creatives feedback that would otherwise have been lost in private channels/email/DMs/not documented at all.\n\n**Leading Research & Workshops**\n\nI got to do some deeper customer insight work in the past 6 months which I think showed real development from my previous [power user research](https://www.notion.so/contactxyz/b14014a932c5473599bec5ae305a2e7e?v=c899ffeb0d9f4f0c8c82bdf3aad12287). I developed a map of our [product positioning](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO7_fqwo=/) and led a series of workshops to help us define our [target customer](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOJf1zRU=/) for the marketplace.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "**Big Changes / Market Conditions**\n\nThis is a bit of an obvious one, but the redundancies and changes to our strategy during Q2 did take us away from our day-to-day goals with the need to realign on quite a few major projects. This isn't a negative as such, as I completely understand our reasoning, it's more of a recognition that it did lead to some distraction/low energy for a while towards the end of the last 6 months. I think I've become very adaptable to change whilst at Contact, so I responded by just looking for the positives in our situation - that now we're more focussed and determined than ever before. \n\n**Long OKR Planning**\n\nWhilst I'm a big fan of iteration, I did find the OKR planning process arduous, and I think we probably overdid the complexity of it. I felt like it left us in limbo for a number of weeks of planning, rather than doing. I'm enjoying our new metrics-driven approach, but I think we need to really work on making sure the process next quarter isn't all-consuming for the best part of 3 weeks.\n\n**Team Relationships**\n\nEarlier in the year, I had some trouble working with Hayley on the brand revamp as I found her way of working difficult which made communication hard. This resulted in feeling out of the loop and was a little anxiety-inducing. I responded by chatting with Jess and Louisa, and we came to a solution and the project was put back on track which resolved any tensions.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "**Product Marketing **\n\nThe past 6 months have given me a chance to hone the skills I've been building over the past few years, leading me to a position where I feel really confident in my ability to lead on initiatives. Particularly, the 6-week GTM course I completed in Feb-April really pushed me forward by validating my processes and approach as a PMM. You can see the shift in my confidence from the course in this graph [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0_GlOGYmmAOzCkGN0faZNdte278O5kU/view?usp=sharing) which was recorded at the beginning and end of the course. \n\n**Product-Mindset **\n\nIn the past 6 months, I've changed managers and integrated into a product team for the first time. I think that working alongside PMs has really enabled me to develop a deeper understanding of how product teams work, and I actually think that I've developed a lot of the skills of a PM in the way I think/analyse/work/prioritise/bring people and ideas together. I really love that I've developed a much deeper product skill set and it's something I want to go deeper with as it feels really intuitive to me.\n\n**Leadership **\n\nI think I've always shown an aptitude for leadership, but in the past 6 months, I've been able to step into that a lot more in helping us lead new initiatives and grow our team. I think I demonstrated this through helping to set up our Growth and Acquisition teams, but also in Marketing as we've brought on new people and started to build out more specialised roles (e.g. content, social), I've been giving a lot of guidance to each team member, inputting to all our marketing outputs. I've also noticed that the way I work on projects is different. Often, I'm delegating a lot more and overseeing, rather than doing all the bits myself. This has helped me develop my skills in delegating and giving feedback. \n\n**Learning**\n\nI've been continuing to push my personal learning in business and strategy through reading alongside work and always bringing these thoughts and ideas back into the business to spark new ideas within the team. I've used my learning budget to help me do so, but I also continually invest in my learning personally. The biggest example of that recently was attending The Do Lectures, where I got to soak up so many wise business learnings which I know will make their way into Contact's future strategy.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "**Product Strategy**\n\nI would like to continue to develop my skills in product strategy so that I can develop my contribution to product development at Contact - particularly at the level of new business opportunities. I'm really inspired by PMMs who take a concept, prove it and then develop it into a new business initiative (this is quite common at places like Meta). I'd love to explore this as a way for my role to grow at Contact!\n\n**Growth Marketing**\n\nI've been learning more and more about growth marketing over the past few years, and I'd like to continue with this and refine my understanding and bring more insights back into the business.",

Helping the team to define tasks fully, breaking down tasks, making sure nothing was missed and adjusting scope were all fundamental to the success of a v1 for the project. Skills I had used before, but not single-handedly since joining Contact.\n\nMentoring more junior engineers was on my list since day 1 of joining Contact and having the opportunity to do that in a more direct capacity at work has felt incredibly fulfilling and allowed me to continue to hone my skills of explaining more complex concepts in an easily understandable way and allowed me to combine my engineering skills in a day to day capacity with my mentoring skills, something that had only existed in 2 separate places previously (inside and outside of work). It has shown to me, once again, the real value in pair programming and that anyone can learn from anyone, regardless of level or experience. As well as the ability to see things that could be missed by staring at a project by yourself for so long, rather than bringing fresh eyes to it.\n\nGetting to further collaborate with design on how things should work within our application has been really enjoyable and something that i hope to continue to have the opportunity to do going forward.",

I did get to explore using Lighthouse and looking into performance improvements a little. I also got to start digging into splitting our CCL library out, with plans to work with design on tidying this as it was moved across and adding testing into it. However, this has all been halted due to the tech improvement time being halted.",

I'd like to continue looking into SSR and learning Next.js. I would like to dig back into Jest and RTL for testing React component and looking at using these with Next.js in mind also.\n\nI want to spend more time with tools for debugging and monitoring and dig back into some services I haven't used for a while like Docker and spend time with some stuff I haven't used for a while, such as a serverless architecture, probably using AWS.",

        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I believe my communication with the wider team has got much better. I feel a lot more confident in having an effective conversation with team members I wouldn't normally talk to. I've also seen an improvement in giving feedback. Previously, when giving feedback I'd let my subjective opinion dominate rather than what's best for the product, but now I've taken a step back and can differ between the two and deliver criticism effectively. Finally, I think my perspective of the product as a whole has considerably improved. Before I had my view of the product trapped in the epic I was currently working on, but now I believe I can see each task as part of a bigger picture towards improving the product as a whole as well as our objectives to get there.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "It's been touched on before, but I'd love to develop my branding skills and see what I can contribute to Contact's eventual rebrand. Also, there was talk of spending some time developing skills in 3D which I'd love to have the L&D time to do in the next period. Finally, whilst it could be a long shot given Contact's stage in the game, I feel like I'm reaching the point in my career where I'd like to develop my management skills and exercise mentoring for new designers (at some point in the foreseeable - I know its a long way off!)",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "The main things that have brought me fulfilment in the past six months have been the HMUA event and the GAUCHO x Contact event. I think this had a great impact in the team as well as the company overall. These events gave us an opportunity to connect with our community and see people face to face after such a long period of time. Particularly with the HMUA event, it showed that we have grown so much and have a strong connection to our community as more than 300 people came to Night Tales. Moreover, our merch launched this year which gave us another opportunity to give back to our community and increase our brand recognition. These items were given out at both events and met with a wave of positive reviews. We've even seen people we don't know personally in places across the UK with our merch which is amazing to see. One of our goals was to increase brand awareness and I feel that through these events and the merch we have been able to achieve this. Our community has grown through partnering with GAUCHO's community and we've been able to form stronger bonds with our community (something that we need to maintain going forward).",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "I had a number of goals that I wanted to work towards and was in the process of working towards. Naturally with the changes that have taken place within the company, it was difficult to achieve these. With my role shifting, my focus and attention now being moved to another area within the company, this has made it challenging to achieve my goals. Personally, it has been frustrating due to the fact that I had been undertaking learning and development in areas related to marketing, branding etc. in order to develop and hone my skills. That being said, although I might be directly using all the skills I have learnt and picked up, they are very much transferrable and will help in my new role. Additionally, I see this as a positive as I can pick things up quickly and have the ability to just put my head down and get on with whatever I'm asked to do.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I think I have become more confident in expressing myself within the team and giving feedback where appropriate. To my surprise I'm also able to handle sales calls very well, talking clients through the platform and highlighting the benefits of using Contact and our unique and unrivalled position within the market. I think this is going to be hugely important going forward as my new role will be very much client facing where I will be on a lot of calls or meeting with individuals face to face. Having the confidence to talk about the platform and express myself clearly and concisely will have a significant impact on whether or not a client decides to use our services. Furthermore, this will also help Contact, and the acquisition team to achieve our goals. As a team we need to work together to achieve our OKRs, having the confidence to speak up, give feedback, comment and challenge your peers will enable us (sales) to achieve our goals as well as collectively (acquisition).",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "- Presentation skills - results, findings, key metrics, retro's etc. \n- Speaking to clients and selling them on what Contact is confidently\n- Brand partnerships - pitching \n\nBeing strong in all of these areas is important not just from a sales perspective, but for whatever role I'm in at Contact. Having the skills, knowledge and the ability to navigate conversations with potential clients and presenting information will bring huge value to the team and the business. I'll be able to share and present ideas internally and externally concisely, only including the necessary information, making sure that it easily digestible and uncomplicated. Speaking and expressing myself clearly without nerves will also be important for me in terms of organising my thought process, making sure I touch on all points I'd set out to cover, and not fumbling on words. These skills will inevitably be important for me winning over clients, which in turn will help the business to generate more income. Whereas from a personal and team perspective, I can grow and advance my career if I'm able to do these things well, with others also having confidence in me which will hopefully help me to climb the ladder within the sales team.",

Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "I bought some changes to the delivery format, such as changing the sprint structure and the meetings. That was very well received and everyone gave great feedback.\n\nI negotiated increased learning days for the engineers and worked their career framework and pdps, so that the engineers could drive their own self development. \n\nI think I give valuable feedback in the leadership meetings. From seeing some of my ideas implemented in the 5 step plan through to question and challenging in our team leads meetings, I think I add value rather than being a spectator in the team.\n\nIt's been nice to bridge the gap between the engineers and other teams such as data and marketing. It was also nice to be able to help out Growth and act as an enabler to get their experiments moving forward.\n\nI think the thing I'm most proud of is the general mentality change in the engineers. 6 months ago, they seemed to work in silos, resistant to change and not very vocal. Although we're far from perfect, I think behind the scenes, theres been a big change in attitude and we've made great strides towards creating a team that willing to drive the business forward.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "Initially I think some developer were apprehensive about my role. This created some tension and anxiety amongst the team. I think we've managed to resolve this really well. It has taken a combination of taking the time to get to know one another. Also several exercises that broke the barrier, such as a feedback session and regular teams get togethers every fortnight where we have discussed difficult topics such as pay rises and redundancies. The team have appreciated the open and honest approach and as a result are a lot more trusting in me.\n\nI also found it a challenge to get engineers to take ownership and drive changes. I think this has started to change but has taken a lot longer than I had anticipated.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "I learned a lot from the feedback that I received towards the beginning. I've begun to understand how challenging the remote working environment is. People's perception of you is built from small glimpses in meetings and from a restricted camera angle. This makes it easier to misunderstand people and their personality. As a result, I've learnt how important it is in this environment to be careful in how you present yourself and the tone in which you use to speak, verbal and written.  \n\nI've also learned to tone down my general direct approach. I like to be direct and address the elephant in the room, however, I've really valued the feedback from the team about how confrontational that can appear.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "I'd like to push forward some tech improvement initiatives, that can bring big value return to the business.\n\nI'd also like to be more hands on with the development so that I can understand the product a lot better.",

        "**What key things have you worked on over the past six months have brought you fulfilment? Describe the impact on the success of your team, department and organization.**": "- Onboarding: In the last 6 months, I joined the company in my first developer role. I feel confident that I have gained a good understanding of the product, company goals and motivations. This might seem minor, but I do think it has been impactful in allowing me to make valuable contributions to tech and wider business conversations. I also had to get up to speed with how the tech team works together, the tech stack used, version control etc - all of which I am comfortable with.\n- Features: I have contributed towards larger features and epics such as the Booker Dashboard and the introduction of Multi-Vertical bookings, both of which have been an integral part of growth for the company, especially in the eyes of the board/investors. This brought me fulfilment as I was able to work on full components on my own and receive feedback to improve them, improving my technical ability. \n- Cypress > Playwright: I worked early on with Kevin to understand how Playwright worked, and have both migrated and written several tests from scratch. This has been important from a technical perspective to ensure our product is robust, especially where Cypress was not acting as expected.\n- QA Process: After pairing on the CAJ flow, I challenged how the QA assessment was happening and started conversations around the QA process, working with the Product Manager and wider team to give feedback and help define potential solutions. This has lead to a much more refined and clear QA process.",
        "What blockers or challenges did you experience in this review period that made it harder to achieve your goals?": "- Family loss: This made it a little hard to focus after returning from holiday, but was able to overcome it thanks to the flexibility, understanding, kindness and support from the team.\n- Redundancies: The news of redundancies in general paired with my role being at risk has shaken me a little and knocked my confidence a bit, but this is something that I am working to bounce back on. I am thankful we were able to come up with an interim solution so that I could continue to grow as a developer, though the reduced hours setup has meant less time working on real tickets/missing some meetings\n- Knowledge gaps: There have been times where my lack of knowledge has kept me from being able to do certain tasks. For example, I started this role not knowing any React which made it hard to even pair on tickets - though this is no longer the case with this example, but there are still things I don't understand and feel unable to contribute to. This can be seen when estimating tickets for example, and not feeling like I can give an accurate estimation as I'm not sure what it would entail to complete the ticket.",
        "In what ways have you developed during this review period?": "- Understanding Contact: I believe I now have a solid understanding of the Contact codebases, which felt overwhelming at first as someone who had never seen a codebase outside of personal projects. I am now able to navigate them more smoothly, therefore work through tasks a bit more quickly.\n- Front End skills: My frontend ability has taken a big leap forward; I started the role not knowing any React and now understand the fundamentals and can build basic components. I have also learnt how to use CSS-in-JS and am confident with testing in Playwright.\n- Confidence: I came into this role keen but extremely nervous to pick up tickets, but am now stepping out of my comfort zone and working on tickets which I wouldn't usually. This comes alongside the confidence to ask for help from colleagues so I can progress when I'm stuck or confused.\n- Coding Collaboration: I have developed my tech team working skills in terms of feeling comfortable reviewing PRs and giving feedback, pairing on more complex tickets that other devs have picked up to learn new things and on my own tickets to become un-stuck, and generally understanding the flow of agile working i.e. through shortcut, sprints, standups etc.",
        "What are 2-3 skills you’d like to acquire, develop or refine over the next review period? Do you feel there is an area of potential that you haven't explored yet?": "- API/Backend: I'd like to spend a bit of time developing my experience with the API codebase as I've not done much there. I think I could achieve this by proactively asking to work on/observe some tickets with Jack. Practicing Ruby/Rails/Rspec will allow me to fulfil my title as a fullstack developer, and hopefully build the confidence to work on my own API tickets so that I can fix bugs or work on features from both a BE and FE perspective.\n- Confidence: This skill is a bit more wishy-washy, but I need to work on building the confidence of my own ability. This has definitely grown immensely since starting at Contact, but did take a step backwards after my role became at risk. \n- GraphQL: I'd like to refine my understanding of GraphQL. I had to use it a lot with the Multi-Vertical epic which took a lot of trial and error sometimes, so I think spending a bit of time to properly understand it in the context of Contact could be good.",
        "If you would like, provide any additional information that wasn't captured in the above form.(optional)": "I just want to reiterate how much of an amazing space Contact has created in which I feel safe to voice my opinions/feedback, and to be vulnerable about how I'm doing with work tasks and from a mental health perspective."
